                <p className="mt-2 mb-3">
                    Hello, I am Ken Zou. I recently graduated from Northeastern University in December 2022 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. 
                </p> 
                <p className="mb-3">
                    Through classes, clubs and co-ops, I have gained experience in software development as well as in web development. This includes being proficient in programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript and SQL and having a strong foundation in object oriented design.
                    
                My last professional experience was as a Software QA Automation Engineer Co-op at Wellframe, where I primarily wrote automation tests to ensure the functionality of their mobile and web applications.

                <p className="mb-3">
                    Outside of school, I'm often either listening to music, watching sports or playing video games. In fact, I'm currently relearning how to play the piano. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently seeking an entry level software engineer role. If you are interested in contacting me, you can reach out to me through my email.
